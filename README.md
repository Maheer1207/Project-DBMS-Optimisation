# DBMS Optimization

## Project Overview

This project was undertaken as part of the Database and File Management coursework. The primary objective was to implement SQL queries for four distinct scenarios using the Python programming language. Each scenario was tested under three different optimization levels: uninformed, self-optimized, and user-optimized. These optimizations and queries were executed on three separate database sets. Subsequently, data visualizations were generated to illustrate the results of these optimizations.

## How It Works

The process begins with running a Python script to extract three database sets from a provided text file. For each dataset, the four SQL queries are executed under all three types of optimization. After executing the queries, bar charts are generated to visualize the performance of these optimizations across the different datasets.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: Used for scripting to extract the databases and execute SQL queries.
- **SQL**: Employed to write and execute the queries for all scenarios.

## Environment Setup

No specific setup is required for this project, as the Python scripts for the queries are ready to run. However, due to course restrictions, the source file from which the databases were generated using the Python script has been removed.
