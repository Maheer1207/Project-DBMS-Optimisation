# DBMS Optimisation

This project was a part of Database and File management course work. The main goal of the project was to implement SQL for four different scenarios, thorough Python programming language. Each of the scenario's are tested in all three optimisation level, uninformed, self-optimized, and user-optimized. Those optimisations and queries were implemented on three different set of database. Following that, data data visualisation were generated of those results. 

## How it works

Initially, a Python script is ran to extract the three sets database of the given text file. Then, on each of the data sets, all four queries are implemented with all three types of optimisations. Then a bar chart, data visualization, is generated of those opimisations on the data sets of each queries.

## Tools Implemented or Playing a Key Role:

1. Python: As a script to extract the database, and also to run queries of those database.
2. SQL: To write the queries for all the scenarios.

## Steps to setup the environment

The project doesn't require any setup, the python script for the query are ready to run. Hoever, due to restrications of the course, I had to remove the source file from which the data base were genrated using the python script.
